# SwiftReady

What does it take to make Objective-C ready for Swift? Since optionals are such an important part of Swift and were not a part of Objective-C for many years there are some integration efforts necessary to bring them together. The [Nullability and Objective-C] blog post covers the various ways that Objective-C can be decorated for optional syntax to make it more compatible with Swift.

There are still features available in the Swift language which are not available in Objective-C such as struct value types, advanced enums and various generics features.

This sample project is based on [The Oatmeal's Babies vs Bears card game] which includes models for `Baby`, `Bear` and `Kitten` from [Exploding Kittens]. Let's have some fun with making Objective-c work well with Swift.
